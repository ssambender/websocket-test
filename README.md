# WEBSOCKET DEMO/TEST

### Demo of Websockets from what I have learned while making my Tierer of Terror game.

This is essentially the minimum working example of the websocket lobby and join system from that game.

#### Some of the features:
- Websocket handshake connection
- Host/join lobby
- Server creating new temp lobbies
- Players can join lobbies by code
- Lobbies removed once all players leave
- Push data to just users in certain lobby
